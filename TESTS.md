Test Procedure We’ll Use
 - Follow your README to run locally.
 - Connect it to a Slack workspace.
 - Send a few messages:
    - E.g “The login button doesn’t work on mobile.” → should appear.
    - E.g. “Can you add export to CSV?” + “I don’t see a button for it right now” → should appear grouped.
    - E.g. “Thanks!” or “See you tomorrow” → should not appear.
